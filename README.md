## Theory of Infinite Automata

An infinite automaton is a mathematical model used to study computations that involve an infinite sequence of symbols. Unlike finite automata, which can only process a fixed number of input symbols, infinite automata can process an infinite stream of input symbols. Infinite automata have important applications in areas such as computer science, logic, and linguistics.
## Objectives

* Understand what a language is and what it needs to have in order to be considered a formal one.

* Provide the initial setup for the evolving project that you will work on during this semester. I said project because usually at lab works, I encourage/impose students to treat all the labs like stages of development of a whole project. Basically you need to do the following:

  a. Create a local && remote repository of a VCS hosting service (let us all use Github to avoid unnecessary headaches);

  b. Choose a programming language, and my suggestion would be to choose one that supports all the main paradigms;

  c. Create a separate folder where you will be keeping the report. This semester I wish I won't see reports alongside source code files, fingers crossed;

According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the grammar definition and do the following tasks:

  a. Implement a type/class for your grammar;

  b. Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the language expressed by your given grammar;

  c. Implement some functionality that would convert and object of type Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton;

  d. For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an input string can be obtained via the state transition from it;

* The Python code above provides a function that takes as input a context-free grammar and a string generated by that grammar. The function then tests whether the string matches the rules of the grammar, and returns either True or False. The code makes use of the parglare library, which provides a convenient way to parse context-free grammars and generate strings from them. Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with context-free grammars in Python.
