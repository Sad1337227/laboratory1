## Theory of Infinite Automata

An infinite automaton is a mathematical model used to study computations that involve an infinite sequence of symbols. Unlike finite automata, which can only process a fixed number of input symbols, infinite automata can process an infinite stream of input symbols. Infinite automata have important applications in areas such as computer science, logic, and linguistics.
## Objectives

The objective of this code is to provide a clear and concise implementation of a function that tests whether a given string matches the rules of a context-free grammar. The code is designed to be easy to read, understand, and modify, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with context-free grammars in Python.
## Description of Code

The Python code above provides a function that takes as input a context-free grammar and a string generated by that grammar. The function then tests whether the string matches the rules of the grammar, and returns either True or False. The code makes use of the parglare library, which provides a convenient way to parse context-free grammars and generate strings from them. Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with context-free grammars in Python.
